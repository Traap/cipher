# cipher
Program a Cipher example I found on StackOverflow

[[How to encrypt files with Ruby?]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11044324/how-to-encrypt-files-with-ruby) was asked June 15th, 2012.  I found the answers useful so I coded up an example with a small twist.  I save the cipher.key and cipher.id to a hash and the persist the hash to a yaml file.
