    This Test Plan demonstrates the Ruby gem Amber functions correctly.  This
    Test plan shows Amber has met the intended-use requirements defined 
    by the designer.  This Test Plan includes the Test Suites listed below.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item  Test Suite cli/options shows all permutations of command line
           options function correctly.
    \item Test Suite utility/substitution demonstrates how Amber substitutes
          values found in Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases to simplify
          test maintenance.
    \item Test Suite tif/structure reveals concepts unique to a Test Input
          Factory
    \item Test Suite advanced-concept demonstrates embedded \LaTeX\ commands
          throughout.
    \end{itemize}

    Amber Test Cases have been designed to showoff Amber concepts.  There are
    many Test Steps that may report failure.  In these cases, an operation 
    system application is simply not installed.  For example, most Linux systems
    come with the man program installed.  Amber will issue a command 'which man'
    and report PASS if man is installed and FAIL if man is not installed.  In
    the failed test case, Amber prints the environment path that was searched.

    In short, Amber simply ran the command it was instructed to run and captured
    the results.  This is sufficient for Amber's validation purposes.
